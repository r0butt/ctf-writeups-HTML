NOPE! just brings up the same page telling me it&#39;s been restricted for hts&#39; security. if i try it via the URL, it just says the page doesn&#39;t exist. i tried cding into /var/, and /etc/ which both failed. i even tried &lt;!--#fsize file=&quot;ztxdhjxn.shtml&quot; → just to see if i COULD touch these files at all; same issue. clearly, these files are not what we are looking for. &lt;!--#exec cmd=&quot;ls ./&quot;→ didn&#39;t work-- &lt;!--#exec cmd=&quot;ls ../&quot;--&gt;, however, did.</p><p><img src="images/9-7.png" alt="images/9-7.png" /></p><p>resolved.</p></div>
